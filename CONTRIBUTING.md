# Contributing Guide  

Welcome to the **NYC Train Mobility** project!  
This guide explains how we collaborate, commit code, and report issues. All templates are included here for convenience.  

---

## Project Workflow  

We use **GitHub flow** + **Agile Scrum practices**:  
1. Work in **feature branches**  
2. Submit changes via **Pull Requests (PRs)**  
3. Keep `main` branch stable  
4. Track tasks on our [Scrum Board](https://alustudent-team1.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/MSPE/boards/34?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiYjg2ZjViOGNhM2FhNDUzNmFhZDg1MzA5OTdlOGU3ZmMiLCJwIjoiaiJ9)

## Branching Strategy  

- `main` → Stable branch (protected)  
- `dev` → Optional integration branch  
- `feature/<name>` → New features  
- `bugfix/<name>` → Bug fixes  
- `hotfix/<name>` → Urgent production fixes  

Example:  
```
git checkout -b feature/etl-cleaning
```

---

## Commit Guidelines

We follow conventional commits:  
- `feat:` – New feature  
- `fix:` – Bug fix  
- `docs:` – Documentation only  
- `test:` – Adding/updating tests  
- `chore:` – Maintenance  

Example:  
```
feat: add XML parser for MoMo SMS input
fix: correct date normalization edge cases
docs: update README with setup instructions
```

## Pull Request Process

- Sync branch with main.  
- Run tests locally:  
  ```
  pytest tests/
  ```  
- Open PR with description + related issue.  
- Request at least one review.  
- Merge after approval.

## Testing

### Assignment-Specific Testing Requirements:
- Data processing and cleaning validation
- Database schema integrity tests  
- Backend API endpoint tests
- Real data validation tests
- Custom algorithm implementation tests


## Custom Algorithm Requirement

**CRITICAL**: You must manually implement at least one algorithm/data structure without using built-in libraries (no heapq, Counter, sort_values, etc.).

### Algorithm Examples:
- Custom filtering/ranking algorithm
- Anomaly detection logic
- Data grouping/aggregation
- Distance calculations
- Trip pattern analysis

### Implementation Must Include:
- [ ] Custom implementation (no libraries)
- [ ] Pseudo-code documentation  
- [ ] Time/space complexity analysis
- [ ] Integration with your system
- [ ] Test coverage for the algorithm

---

## Code Style

- Python → [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) (black, flake8)  
- JavaScript → ESLint defaults  
- Naming → descriptive, consistent

---

## Assignment Deliverables

### Required Submissions:
- [ ] **Codebase** (.zip + GitHub link)
- [ ] **Video walkthrough** (5 minutes max)
- [ ] **PDF documentation** (2-3 pages) 
- [ ] **README** with complete setup instructions
- [ ] **Database dump/schema files**
- [ ] **Meaningful commit history**

### Documentation Must Include:
1. **Problem framing and dataset analysis**
   - Dataset description and challenges
   - Data cleaning assumptions
   - One unexpected observation

2. **System architecture diagram**
   - Frontend, backend, database design
   - Technology stack justification

3. **Custom algorithm implementation**
   - Pseudo-code and complexity analysis
   - Real-world problem it solves

4. **Three meaningful data insights**
   - How derived (query/algorithm/viz)
   - Visual evidence (charts/screenshots)
   - Urban mobility interpretation

5. **Reflection and future work**
   - Technical challenges
   - Team collaboration insights
   - Real-world product improvements

### Video Walkthrough Requirements:
**5-minute video must cover:**
- [ ] System overview & architecture
- [ ] Technical choices explanation
- [ ] Working feature demonstrations
- [ ] Custom algorithm explanation

** Note**: Submissions without video receive zero grade.

### Academic Integrity:
- **AI usage ONLY allowed for README**
- All code must be original work
- No AI-generated documentation/insights
- Violations = academic misconduct
