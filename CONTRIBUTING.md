# Contributing Guide  

Welcome to the **NYC Train Mobility** project!  
This guide explains how we collaborate, commit code, and report issues. All templates are included here for convenience.  

---

## Project Workflow  

We use **GitHub flow** + **Agile Scrum practices**:  
1. Work in **feature branches**  
2. Submit changes via **Pull Requests (PRs)**  
3. Keep `main` branch stable  
4. Track tasks on our [Scrum Board](https://alustudent-team1.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/NTMA/summary) 

---

## Branching Strategy  

- `main` → Stable branch (protected)  
- `dev` → Optional integration branch  
- `feature/<name>` → New features  
- `bugfix/<name>` → Bug fixes  
- `hotfix/<name>` → Urgent production fixes  

Example:  
```
git checkout -b feature/etl-cleaning
```

---

## Commit Guidelines

We follow conventional commits:  
- `feat:` – New feature  
- `fix:` – Bug fix  
- `docs:` – Documentation only  
- `test:` – Adding/updating tests  
- `chore:` – Maintenance  

Example:  
```
feat: add XML parser for MoMo SMS input
fix: correct date normalization edge cases
docs: update README with setup instructions
```

---

## Pull Request Process

- Sync branch with main.  
- Run tests locally:  
  ```
  pytest tests/
  ```  
- Open PR with description + related issue.  
- Request at least one review.  
- Merge after approval.

---

## Testing

- All new features must include unit tests.  
- Fixes should include regression tests.  
- Run tests:  
  ```
  pytest tests/
  ```

---

## Code Style

- Python → [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) (black, flake8)  
- JavaScript → ESLint defaults  
- Naming → descriptive, consistent
